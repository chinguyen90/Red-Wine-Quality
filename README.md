# Red Wine Quality

This paper is about the regression analysis done on the Red Wine Quality data set. The paper first discusses about the data variables and later talks about the model building procedure, diagnostic checks and various test used to test the model. In the end, the final regression model is formed along with formal tests. We discuss limitation of the study in the end.

Research questions: Is there a linear regression relationship between the quality of red wine and its attributes? What attributes are statistically significant to the red wine quality?
